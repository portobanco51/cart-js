# Cart-js

### `Quick intro`

Javascript based project focused on practicing some ES6+ basic functions like **`Modules / Promises / .fetch / Async & Await / localStorage / DOM / (...REST).`**

Implemented some **`AJAX`** form verifications with **`JQuery.`**

Moreover, just for it to be **acceptable** a sprinkle of **_`Bootstraps4 & Sweetalert.js.`_**

Overall, a simple eCommerce feature.
